# This is an example of how to deploy kubernetes-aws-authenticator.
#
# To use this, you'll at least need to edit the role ARNs in the ConfigMap. You
# may also need to rework other bits to work in your cluster (e.g., node labels).
#
# This was tested with a kubeadm-installed cluster.

      # session name). It has the benefit of letting you include the EC2
      # instance ID (e.g., "i-0123456789abcdef0") in the generated username.
